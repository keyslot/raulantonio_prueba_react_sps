# users-mobile

This project is part of SPS proofs. 
 
These comments are in the file ./App.js  
 
## Problems with this App:
1. I could not write an `onClick` event properly.
2. Following the prev. point, I didn't other screen. I was reading: https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation.
3. I used the example for use Images: https://reactnative.dev/docs/images
4. And this doc. for use style: https://reactnative.dev/docs/stylesheet 
5. The schema of the list of users is an HTML.table concept.
